(I will not hold you to any project ideas written here; you are welcome to change your mind later.)\n\n## Notes\n\n* There are many guides out there on how to use markdown syntax.  The following is one example you may find useful:\n  * [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)\n* In this assignment notebook, you will find that you are unable to alter the content of the cells that I have written -> this is on purpose.  However, you will be able to edit and run all response cells.\n* After writing your responses in markdown, execute the cells so that your markdown text gets rendered."
